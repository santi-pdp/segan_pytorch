### Audio Samples

Latest denoising audio samples with baselines can be found in the [segan+ samples website](http://veu.talp.cat/seganp/). SEGAN is the vanilla SEGAN version (like the one in TensorFlow repo), whereas SEGAN+ is the shallower improved version included as default parameters of this repo.

The voicing/dewhispering audio samples can be found in the [whispersegan samples website](http://veu.talp.cat/whispersegan). Artifacts can now be palliated a bit more with `--interf_pair` fake signals, more data than the one we had available (just 20 mins with 1 speaker per model) and longer training session by iterating more than `100 epoch`.

### Pretrained Models

SEGAN+ generator weights are released and can be downloaded in [this link](http://veu.talp.cat/seganp/release_weights/segan+_generator.ckpt). Make sure you place this file into the `ckpt_segan+` directory to make it work with the proper `train.opts` config file within that folder. The script `run_segan+_clean.sh` will properly read the ckpt in that directory as it is configured to be used with this referenced file.

### Introduction to scripts

Two models are ready to train and use to make wav2wav speech enhancement conversions. SEGAN+ is an
improved version of SEGAN [1], denoising utterances with its generator network (G). 

![SEGAN+_G](assets/segan+.png)

To train this model, the following command should be run:

```
python train.py --save_path ckpt_segan+ --batch_size 300 \
		--clean_trainset data/clean_trainset \
		--noisy_trainset data/noisy_trainset \
		--cache_dir data/cache
```

Read `run_segan+_train.sh` for more guidance. This will use the default parameters to structure both G and D, but they can be tunned with many options. For example, one can play with `--d_pretrained_ckpt` and/or `--g_pretrained_ckpt` to specify a departure pre-train checkpoint to fine-tune some characteristics of our enhancement system, like language, as in [2].

Cleaning files is done by specifying the generator weights checkpoint, its config file from training and appropriate paths for input and output files (Use `soundfile` wav writer backend (recommended) specifying the `--soundfile` flag):

```
python clean.py --g_pretrained_ckpt ckpt_segan+/<weights_ckpt_for_G> \
		--cfg_file ckpt_segan+/train.opts --synthesis_path enhanced_results \
		--test_files data/noisy_testset --soundfile
```

Read `run_segan+_clean.sh` for more guidance.

There is a WSEGAN, which stands for the dewhispering SEGAN [3]. This system is activated (rather than vanilla SEGAN) by specifying the `--wsegan` flag. Additionally, the `--misalign_pair` flag will add another fake pair to the adversarial loss indicating that content changes between input and output of G is bad, something that improved our results for [3].

### Notes

* Multi-GPU is not supported yet in this framework.
* Virtual Batch Norm is not included as in the very first SEGAN code, as similar results to those of original paper can be obtained with regular BatchNorm in D (ONLY D).
